# STM32F407 Project

This is a program to control the STM32F407 Discovery kit utilising three level multi-thread systems. The main file initialises the four LEDs and accelerometer LIS3DSH. 

The functions for the project are:
1. Lighting up LEDs corresponding to the tilt direction of the board
2. Blinking LEDs with 0.5s interval
3. Switch between the two tasks when user press and release the button
